# Task manager

This application is a simple task manager that will use react-native for a mobile app, nest-js for back-end and maybe some nuxt (or next) for a web application.

This project was developed for educational purposes.

## Goals

-   User can create his profile and/or log in.
-   User can have many tasks.
-   User can have recurring tasks during the week.
-   User can have tasks that can be concluded during the day and tasks that need to be concluded in a specific hour.

## Goals ideas

-   Integrate it with platforms like Github for things like "GitHub contribution metas".
-   Create some sort of gamification.
